Usage:

    print("now:                   \(Date.init())")
    print("8 days later:          \(8.days.fromNow)")
    print("2 weeks before:        \(2.weeks.ago)")
    print("5 days, 3 month later: \((5.days + 3.months).fromNow)")
  
Output:
 
    now:                   2017-06-06 10:42:23 +0000
    8 days later:          2017-06-14 10:42:23 +0000
    2 weeks before:        2017-05-23 10:42:23 +0000
    5 days, 3 month later: 2017-09-11 10:42:23 +0000
    
    
Note:

This library was originally written as [SwiftDateTimeExtensions](https://github.com/schluete/SwiftDateTimeExtensions) but it was too old for new Swift version and needed improvements.

I am also planning to add more features to this class in future thus created a separate repo instead a fork.
